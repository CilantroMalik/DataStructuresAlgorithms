"""
--- Shell Sort Increment Experimentation ---
Provides two implementations of the Shell Sort algorithm with different schemes for how to divide the list into
sublists for sorting by this algorithm. One of them uses simple division by 2 to come up with the increments, while
the other uses Mersenne numbers for increments, as these have been mathematically determined to be among the most
efficient incrementing schemes for this family of algorithm. Otherwise, the logic is identical â€” each sublist is sorted
with a slightly modified insertion sort, then the increments are re-computed and the process starts again, and by the end 
the whole list is sorted. We also include a timed test at the end to compare the two implementations.
