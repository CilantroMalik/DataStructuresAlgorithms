--- Hash Table: Implementing the Map ADT ---
This is an implementation of the Map abstract data type, which entails a data structure that has keys and values in
pairwise association. This type of implementation has the advantage that getting, setting, and searching are all O(1)
operations in terms of time complexity, and it accomplishes this by using a "hash function", a mathematical function
that transforms any given key into a numerical value, to decide where to locate each key-value pair, which makes it
trivial to find it later â€” just reapply the hash function and retrieve from that index.
